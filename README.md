# Q
## What is Q?
#### Basic Premise
Q is a piece of productivity software that will allow you to keep track of tasks or assignments and their due dates. Once Q is started up it will ask you for the name of the Q you want to load. Anytime you want to make a new Q, or the first time you boot up, type any name, and a new Q with that name will be created and saved. If you already have a Q created, enter its name when prompted and it will be loaded up for you. Once you have done so, you may type '''help''' for a list of supported commands and their functions.

#### Support and Updates
I work on this in my free time and add updates as I feel the need for them. It is mainly a program for my own daily usage, so it may not be the most user friendly for others at times. Email me at oresteturchetti@gmail.com if you have any questions.
## Usage
#### Startup
Clone or download the files. Serialized files will be stored in the folder where the files are located. Compile within that folder by navigating to it in terminal and typing the command 
'''javac Main.java'''. This only needs to be done the first time or whenever you pull new updates. Anytime you want to run Q from then on, navigate again to that folder in terminal and type the command '''java Main'''.

## Known Errors
Hopefully not many.
#### ANSI Escape Codes
While text coloring for completion percentage works on terminal (macOS), I don't think it shows up in git bash on Windows.
